Whether your business is run by a single person or a team, Dropifi’s collaborative inbox is designed to help you support as many customers in as little time as possible. Customer requests are automatically organized into smart categories and you can see which members of your team followed up with a specific customer.

With Dropifi’s widget, you can boost sales with authentic word-of-mouth referrals. Collect the great things your best customers are saying about you on Facebook, Twitter, and other social media networks and display them on your website.
 
**Make better business decisions:** 
What do most of your customers really think about your company? What qualities do your happiest customers share? What do they complain about the most? Dropifi’s powerful sentiment analysis helps you track the emotions behind all the messages sent to your organization.
